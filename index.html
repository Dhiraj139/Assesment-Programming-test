        In the Question provided to us there were some mistakes in counting.<br />
        <br />[1]. In correct answer scoring you gave 1 point for the word
        "calendar" instead of 3 points because of 7+ letters word after that
        full score would be "18"<br />
        <br />[2]. In Candidate Response Scoring you gave 0 piont to "14"
        instead of 4 because it is a number after that candidates's score would
        be "10"
