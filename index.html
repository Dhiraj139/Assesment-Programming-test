      <p>in the Question provided to us there was a mistake in counting.<br>
in correct answer scoring you give 1 points for the word "celender" instead of 3 points because of 7+ letters word after that full score would be "18"<br>
in Candidate Response Scoring you give 0 pionts to "14" instead of 4 because it is a letter after that candidates's score would be "10"
